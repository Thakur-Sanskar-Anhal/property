Blockchain Project

Aim:.

The aim of the project is to tokenize the land registry system and take it on blockchain so that the security and transparency of the land distribution i.e.- purchase , sale , lease can be created with a proof and can be tamper free.

Aim explanation:

Humein India ke sabhi property related documents ko blockchain pe leke jaana h taaki unko tamper karna bhi mushkil ho aur destroy karna bhi aur ek record rahe kisne kisse kya purchase kiya sell kiya kis rate pe kiya kab kiya ya fir kisne kisko kabtak ke liye kuch lease kiya aur kya rate pe kiya. Isme hum har citizen ka aadhar card no. daal sakte h taaki uske owner ka ek national identity proof ho. Isse govt ko bhi help milegi corruption rokne mei aur normal logo ko bhi help milegi fraud se bachne mei.

Problem Statement:

- In many regions of India land mafia exists till date. They try to illegally occupy the land that is not owned by them by creating counterfeit documents and occupying the land by force.
  - Land mafias are not a problem of a specific state of India, they are present in almost all the states and are oppressing poor and helpless people.
  - Land mafia problem is not new for the country it has been dating back since the independence of India i.e. 1947
- Counterfeiting of property related documents is common by getting access to old stamp papers and skilfully copying signs of the owners to make fake documents.
  - There have been multiple cases of counterfeiting and fraudulent activities based on counterfeiting.
  - Abdul Karim telgi was the biggest known convicted Indian counterfeiter. He earned money by printing counterfeit stamp paper in India, with the size of the scam estimated to be around ₹30 thousand crores.
- Loosing or misplacing property documents is also possible by multiple reasons may it be artificial or natural reasons.
  - Even the documents stored within the govt facilities are not safe, taking the case of recent fires that occurred a few years ago in tis hazari court where many of the old documents were burned.
  - Natural disasters like floods and fires cause many of such documents to be destroyed and be misplaces. Whereas getting those documents back from the govt is possible it is not at all cheap or easy or fast.
- Fraudulent property transactions are common in India, many people with power tend to buy properties in the name of others.
  - Property purchase or sale done using black money is a big problem that needs to be tackled in India.
  - There have been many cases in which politicians or fraudulent people have been caught with way too much un disclosed property.

Problem Solution:

This problem can be solved by creating a blockchain that stores all the transactions of property and is public, available to all.

- We can tackle all the above mentioned problems by shifting the traditional method of storing property related contracts to the blockchain.
- We can develop a basic frontend that can be easy to use with a lot of UI/UX enhancements so even old people can understand it and read it easily.
- The contract can be stored with a transaction address that can easily be linked to ones adhar card or digi locker.
- This will give you easy access to all the properties you bought and the documents to those properties would be easy to access and find.
- This will also tackle the big problem of black money and illegal purchase and sale of properties.

Steps we can follow to implement:

1. **Define Requirements and Use Cases**:
    - Start by conducting thorough research to understand the pain points and inefficiencies in property transactions. Identify what tasks need improvement, such as property listings, ownership transfers, or rental agreements.
    - Create detailed use cases that outline how your blockchain solution will address these challenges. For example, one use case might be streamlining the process of verifying property ownership during a sale.
2. **Choose the Right Blockchain Platform**:
    - If you decide to build your blockchain from scratch, you'll need to have a strong understanding of blockchain technology and programming skills.
    - Alternatively, you can use existing blockchain platforms like Ethereum, which provide tools and frameworks for building decentralized applications (dApps). These platforms offer ready-made solutions for handling transactions, smart contracts, and data storage.
3. **Smart Contract Development**:
    - Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement written in code. They automate the execution of transactions and enforce the rules of the agreement without the need for intermediaries.
    - Develop smart contracts for various property-related transactions, such as property transfers, rental agreements, or escrow services. These contracts should include conditions, rules, and triggers for executing actions automatically.
4. **Tokenization of Properties**:
    - Tokenization involves representing real-world assets, such as properties, as digital tokens on a blockchain. Each token represents ownership or a share of ownership in a property.
    - Define the parameters for tokenizing properties, such as the token supply, ownership rights, and fractional ownership options. Determine how tokens will be created, traded, and managed within the blockchain ecosystem.
5. **User Interface Development**:
    - Design user-friendly interfaces that allow users to interact with your blockchain platform. This includes web applications, mobile apps, and other graphical interfaces.
    - Consider the needs of different user groups, such as property buyers, sellers, landlords, and tenants. Design intuitive interfaces that guide users through property transactions, from searching for listings to completing transactions.
6. **Integration with External Systems**:
    - Integrate your blockchain platform with external systems and services to enhance functionality and ensure compliance. This may include integrating with government property registries, identity verification services, payment gateways, and legal databases.
    - Implement APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) and data feeds to facilitate seamless communication between your blockchain platform and external systems.
7. **Security and Privacy Measures**:
    - Implement robust security measures to protect the integrity and confidentiality of data stored on the blockchain. This includes encryption, cryptographic hashing, and secure access controls.
    - Ensure that sensitive information, such as personal data and financial transactions, is encrypted and only accessible to authorized parties. Regularly audit and test your blockchain platform for vulnerabilities and security flaws.
8. **Community Engagement and Adoption**:
    - Engage with stakeholders in the real estate industry, including property developers, agents, buyers, sellers, and regulators. Educate them about the benefits of blockchain technology for property transactions and address any concerns or misconceptions they may have.
    - Provide training programs, workshops, and documentation to help users understand how to use your blockchain platform effectively. Offer incentives and rewards to early adopters to encourage participation and adoption.
9. **Regulatory Compliance**:
    - Ensure that your blockchain platform complies with relevant laws, regulations, and industry standards governing property transactions. Work closely with legal experts and regulatory authorities to identify and address compliance requirements.
    - Implement features and safeguards to ensure transparency, auditability, and legal validity of transactions conducted on your blockchain platform. This may include timestamping, digital signatures, and compliance reporting tools.
10. **Continuous Improvement and Innovation**:
    - Monitor user feedback and analytics to identify areas for improvement and innovation. Continuously update and enhance your blockchain platform with new features, optimizations, and security enhancements.
    - Stay informed about emerging trends and technologies in blockchain and real estate industries. Explore opportunities for integrating new technologies, such as AI, IoT, or decentralized finance (DeFi), to further enhance the capabilities of your blockchain platform.

Pseudo Code for the smart contract:

contract PropertyRegistry {

// Define property struct

struct Property {

address owner;

string location;

uint256 price;

uint256 leaseDuration; // New parameter for lease duration

}

// Mapping of property IDs to Property struct

mapping(uint256 => Property) public properties;

// Emit an event to log the purchase

emit PropertyPurchased(msg.sender, \_location, \_price);

}

// Function to record a property rental

function recordPropertyRental(string memory \_location, uint256 \_price, uint256 \_leaseDuration) public {

// Record property rental transaction

properties\[block.timestamp\] = Property(msg.sender, \_location, \_price, \_leaseDuration);

emit PropertyRented(msg.sender, \_location, \_price, \_leaseDuration);

}

}

Explanation:

1. **Property Struct**:
    - Defines a struct called Property with three fields: owner (address of the property owner), location (string representing the property's location), and price (uint256 representing the property's price).
2. **Mapping**:
    - Uses a mapping properties to map property IDs (uint256) to instances of the Property struct. This allows storing property details based on their IDs.
3. **Events**:
    - Declares two events: PropertyPurchased and PropertyRented to log property purchase and rental transactions, respectively.
4. **recordPropertyPurchase** Function:
    - recordPropertyPurchase function records a property purchase transaction.
    - It takes \_location (string) and \_price (uint256) as input parameters.
    - It assigns a new Property struct instance with the sender's address, location, and price to the properties mapping using the current block's timestamp as the key.
    - Emits a PropertyPurchased event to log the purchase.
5. **recordPropertyRental** Function:
    - recordPropertyRental function records a property rental transaction.
    - Similar to recordPropertyPurchase, it takes \_location and \_price as input parameters.
    - It also assigns a new Property struct instance to the properties mapping with the sender's address, location, and price using the current block's timestamp as the key.
    - Emits a PropertyRented event to log the rental.

In summary, this contract allows users to record property purchases and rentals by storing the details in a mapping based on timestamps. Events are emitted to provide a log of the transactions.
